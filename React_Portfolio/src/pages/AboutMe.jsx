            <p>
                My name is Carlos Enrique De La Torre and I'm from Southern Arizona. I have an accumulation of 10 years in customer service and retail.
                Now I'm trying to branch out by attending a Coding Boot Camp, sponsored by ASU. Initially I thought that my story into coding started in 2020 during the pandemic.
                My motivation for taking a coding Boot Camp was to be productive outside my job while I was recovering from a kidney transplant. In 2019 was diagnosed with kidney failure and had to start dialysis. 
                At that moment I decided to uproot my life from Phoenix to Tucson to be close to family and focused entirely on my health. I was on dialysis for 4 years and on April 2023 God blessed me with a kidney transplant, thanks to the prayers from family, friends and strangers.
                Right after my transplant I got a Facebook ad for ASU's Coding Boot Camp and I decided to take a leap of faith and enroll because I thought to myself: "I can either stay home and play video games or I can learn a new skill to better myself."
                If you're seeing this then you can make the deduction that I chose the latter. My motivation to keep coding came when I finally had the energy to complete a deep cleaning of my room and found a bucket list I wrote before moving away from my hometown of Douglas, Arizona. 
                On that list I had written that I wanted to learn how to code. I had completely forgotten about that list and it was a sign that I was on the right path, especaially since on my spare time I would use Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets to record a plethera of personal information.
                I created spreadsheets for tracking my blood pressure, weight, dialysis treatments, schedules for school, traking changes in medication, fiances, workout regimes and meal plans. I was using Excel and Google Sheets to track my life but I disliked the UI.
                I knew I wanted to create my own UI and make it more user friendly. I wanted to create a program that would take all the information I was tracking and create a report that I could share with my doctors. I wanted to create a program that would help me and others like me.
                I'm currently working on my coding skills, learning new coding languages, and learing about photography at my local community college. Most important I'm also working on my health and trying to get back to my normal life.
